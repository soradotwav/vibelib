## Installation

Install vibelib using pip:

```bash
pip install vibelib
```

### System Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- OpenAI API access credentials
- Network connectivity for model inference

## Quick Start

```python
import vibelib
import os

# Configure API credentials
os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = 'your-openai-api-key'

# Execute AI-powered sorting
data = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
sorted_result = vibelib.sort(data)
print(f"Sorted data: {sorted_result}")

# Perform mathematical operations
numbers = [15, 32, 8, 47, 23]
maximum_value = vibelib.max(numbers)
sum_total = vibelib.sum(numbers)

# Process text data
text_input = "enterprise software development"
processed_text = vibelib.upper(text_input)
tokenized = vibelib.split(processed_text, " ")
```

## API Reference

### Mathematical Operations
```python
vibelib.max(items, api_key=None)     # Find maximum value with type preservation
vibelib.min(items, api_key=None)     # Find minimum value with type preservation  
vibelib.sum(items, api_key=None)     # Calculate sum with automatic type inference
vibelib.abs(number, api_key=None)    # Compute absolute value maintaining type
```

### Sorting Operations
```python
vibelib.sort(items, api_key=None)    # AI-powered intelligent sorting algorithm
```

### String Processing
```python
vibelib.upper(string, api_key=None)              # Convert to uppercase
vibelib.lower(string, api_key=None)              # Convert to lowercase  
vibelib.split(string, separator, api_key=None)   # Split string by delimiter
vibelib.join(items, separator, api_key=None)     # Join elements with separator
vibelib.strip(string, api_key=None)              # Remove leading/trailing whitespace
vibelib.replace(string, old, new, api_key=None)  # Replace substring occurrences
```

### List Operations
```python
vibelib.count(items, value, api_key=None)    # Count value occurrences
vibelib.index(items, value, api_key=None)    # Find first occurrence index
vibelib.reverse(items, api_key=None)         # Reverse list order
```

## Configuration

### Environment Configuration
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

### Advanced Configuration
```python
from vibelib import Config, Client
from vibelib.operations import SortingService

config = Config(
    api_key="your-api-key",
    model="gpt-4",           # Model selection
    temperature=0.3,         # Response creativity (0.0-1.0)
    timeout=45.0,           # Request timeout (seconds)
    max_retries=3           # Retry attempts
)

client = Client(config)
service = SortingService(client)
result = service.sort([5, 2, 8, 1, 9])
```

## Error Handling

vibelib provides comprehensive exception management:

```python
from vibelib.exceptions import (
    vibelibError,        # Base exception class
    ConfigurationError,  # Configuration-related errors
    APIError,           # API communication failures  
    ParseError,         # Response parsing errors
    ValidationError     # Input validation errors
)

try:
    result = vibelib.sort(dataset)
except ValidationError as e:
    logger.error(f"Input validation failed: {e}")
except APIError as e:
    logger.error(f"API communication error: {e}")
```

## Performance and Scalability

- **Maximum Input Size**: 10,000 elements per operation
- **Response Time**: Dependent on AI model inference latency
- **Concurrency**: Thread-safe operation with intelligent service caching

**Disclaimer**: While vibelib represents a fascinating exploration of AI-driven computational methods, please note that this library is primarily a demonstration of how AI can be integrated into traditional programming tasks. For production systems requiring optimal performance, cost efficiency, or offline operation, conventional algorithmic implementations remain the recommended approach.

In other words: Yes, this is a joke library that uses AI to do things your computer can do instantly without an internet connection or API costs. But hey, it works, and the code quality is genuinely enterprise-grade! Use it to impress your friends, confuse your colleagues, or as a very expensive way to sort an array. We won't judge. Much.
